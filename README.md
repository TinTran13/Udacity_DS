# UDACITY Seattle Airbnb Analysis

This project utilizes the [Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) for the **UDACITY Project - Write a Data Science Blog**.

## Installation
Apart from the Anaconda Python package, no additional libraries are required. The code should run smoothly on Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Since 2008, Airbnb has transformed travel experiences, offering distinct and personalized options for visitors and hosts worldwide. This project delves into the data analysis of millions of Airbnb listings, vital for security, business decisions, customer and host behavior understanding, marketing strategies, and more.

The **Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset** chronicles homestay listings in Seattle, Washington from 01-2016 to 01-2017.

The dataset includes 3 subsets:
1. **calendar.csv**: Pricing details for each listing on specific days.
2. **listings.csv**: Detailed description and review scores for each listing.
3. **reviews.csv**: Detailed reviews for individual listings.

In this project, we utilize **calendar.csv** and **listings.csv** to address 3 business questions using CRISP-DM steps:
1. Identifying Seattle's peak activity period.
2. Pinpointing the most crowded areas in Seattle.
3. Price prediction.
